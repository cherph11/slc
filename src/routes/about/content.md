# ♻️ About This Project

Welcome to **PlasticWise** – your guide to understanding plastic types, their environmental impacts, and how to recycle them responsibly.

Plastics are everywhere – in our homes, schools, offices, and oceans. But not all plastics are created equal, and not all are recyclable in the same way. Our mission is to **educate, simplify, and empower** individuals to make better choices when it comes to plastic use and disposal.
